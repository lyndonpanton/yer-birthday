# yer-birthday
Exercise 8 of the "C# Class Development" course of the "C# Programming for Unity Game Development" Specialization by the University of Colorado via Coursera

## Description

Problem 1 – Birthday Fun

Create a new console application named Exercise8. Your program will read in a user’s birthday as a month (January, February, etc.) followed by the day and echo that information to the user. 

Start by prompting for and getting the month of the user’s birthday

    Print an appropriate message to the user asking for their birth month

    Read the value from the user

    Store the value in an appropriate variable

Next, prompt for and get the day of the user’s birthday

    Print an appropriate message to the user asking for their birth day

    Read the value from the user

    Convert (Parse) the value as appropriate. You should NOT be storing the day as a stringstring!

    Store the value in an appropriate variable

Finally, print out the stored values to the user with an appropriate message

Problem 2 – Reminders

Add code to display what day a reminder email will be sent to the user inviting them to visit an in-game store on their birthday for 20% off.  Your program must display that the reminder will be sent on the day before the user’s birthday. 

Specifically, your additional code should print a message to the user stating the month and day they will receive a reminder (see Hint below).

Hint:  What if the user puts in the first day of the month (e.g., July 1)?  What value will your application print?  This is a bug!  We won't worry about that here as we practice with strings, so leave the bug and ignore the problem.
